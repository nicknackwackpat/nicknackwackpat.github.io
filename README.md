# Homework2

In this assignment I was able to create my own portfolio site using Bootstrap templates and custom CSS. I created three HTML pages: 

1. index.html, the home page.
2. portfolio.html, showcasing my coding assignments and projects.
3. contact.html, a contact form used for networking.

I'm excited to find out what the rest of this program has to offer!
